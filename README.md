### Number Guesser Game ####
### Design and created by Haider ###

Here's your text with spelling and grammar corrections:

"I contributed to the 'MiniGamesProject', specifically focusing on the 'Number Guesser' game, a fun number prediction game where the user has to try to guess the number. As a developer, I implemented the following features:

1. I allowed the user to guess a number.
2. I allowed the user to receive hints based on the number they chose.
3. I allowed the users to see the previous numbers they have chosen.
4. Designed an easy-to-use interface with a hot-cold theme that matches the aesthetics of the website.

Challenges I faced included ensuring that my text does not go over the designated container. To address this, I referenced previous lecture notes and YouTube tutorials to set the CSS attributes.

### Rock Paper Scissor Game ####
### Design and created by Awaab ###
Created the game display region that is divided into game display and score description area.
The score description section is further subdivided into Game Description and Score.
Designed how the game display area would look like and integrated functionalities of 
a normal rock, paper, scissors activity using buttons as input from the user.
There are only 5 rounds for the game until a winner is decided.
Game is turn-based:
     - User has to wait for computer response and round result before selecting another option
     - Once it is the user's turn, will display above the "weapon choices" buttons "Your turn"
Game is designed to have 3 match outcomes: win, lose, or tie
Game theme is tied with neon/arcade style aesthetic look and incorporates brightly colored buttons 
contrasting the dark background display. 
     -All pictures,gifs were sourced from Canva or Unsplash free images
     -Game Title was specially designed in Canva platform
