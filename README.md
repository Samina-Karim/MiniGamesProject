Haider Mir:

I contributed to the 'MiniGamesProject', specifically focusing on the 'Number Guesser' game, a fun number prediction game where the user has to try to guess the number. As a developer, I implemented the following features:

1. I allowed the user to guess a number.
2. I allowed the user to receive hints based on the number they chose.
3. I allowed the users to see the previous numbers they have chosen.
4. Designed an easy-to-use interface with a hot-cold theme that matches the aesthetics of the website.

Challenges I faced included ensuring that my text does not go over the designated container. To address this, I referenced previous lecture notes, W3School and YouTube tutorials to set the CSS attributes.

Technologies and Tools I used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the assistance of Git, GitHub, YouTube, ChatGPT, and VS Code.

I hope that you enjoy this number guesser game with your friends and family!
